# Fashion Products Images (small)

A data set is available on Kaggle called [Fashion Product Images (small)](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small).  This folder
contains tools and utilities for working with that data.  An IPython notebook called `Styles_to_Product_Search` will convert the `styles.csv` to Product Search
format CSV data ready for creating the Product Search catalog.
